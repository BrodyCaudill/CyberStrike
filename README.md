# CyberStrike
 
This is my senior capstone project. Every group was tasked with implementing the board game "Hive" with their own twist for a competion. I worked on a team of 5 as the game-core and AI co-lead. As the game-core co-lead I assisted in the design and implementation of how the game will be played and ensuring rules cannot be broken. As the AI co-lead I designed and implemented much of the AI including what algorithm to use and what heuristics to use. Being in both gam-core and AI I was able to ensure our game-core was written very efficiently to enable our AI to search through more moves. For the Senior Capstone competition my team placed 2nd overall, and I was awarded 1st place for the AI component. If you are looking to play the game you must download and open the project using Unity 2020 or later.
